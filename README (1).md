# Machine learning Project 
## Ameriacan Sign Language Detection using CNN

#### Module 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
* Collect a large dataset of ASL videos or images
* Preprocess the data by resizing, cropping, and normalizing
* Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets

#### Module 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
* Design and train a CNN model to recognize ASL signs using the preprocessed dataset
* Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set and fine-tune as necessary

#### Module 3: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
* Use transfer learning to adapt the CNN model for ASL recognition
* Fine-tune the model on a smaller dataset of ASL signs specifically

#### Module 4: Sign Language Recognition System
* Integrate the trained CNN model with a sign language recognition system
* Implement user interface components such as video input, output, and gesture recognition

#### Module 5: Evaluation and Testing
* Evaluate the performance of the ASL recognition system on a test dataset
* Analyze results and identify areas for improvement

 #### Module 6: Deployment and Maintenance
 * Deploy the ASL recognition system in a real-world setting, such as a hospital or school
 * Maintain the system by updating the model, fixing bugs, and improving performance over time
